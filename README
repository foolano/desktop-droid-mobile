Desktop-droid
=============

desktop-droid is a set of applications that allow an android phone
to send events to your desktop computer.

It is composed of three pieces of software:

1. Android app

This application needs to be installed on your android phone in order to
capture events and send them to the server.

2. Server app

This application needs to be deployed on the Internet to allow your android
and desktop to talk to each other.

Note that there is a default server already deployed that you may use instead of
setting up one for yourself.

3. Desktop app

This application is installed on your desktop and talks to the server. It will
wait until an event happens to be displayed.
